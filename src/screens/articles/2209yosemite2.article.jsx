             long and sustained. The: if you could go anywhere, you’d go right up the middle of
              that bit. The Nose is exactly that bit of El Capitan. And El Capitan is that bit
               of Yosemite. Just shy of a vertical kilometre, the central prow of El Capitan is
                more than two and a half times the height of the Empire State Building. It's
                 the tallest continuous rock face in the Yosemite Valley, and there 
                are only a small handful of walls any larger across the world. The protruding 
                Nose steps into the East-West valley to such an extent that its vast 
                flanks take turns in a cool shade each day.`}/>

            <ArticleText text={`Only around 10 people have free-climbed the Nose at the time 
            of writing this. Yet, the route is the busiest climb in the valley. A few very 
            difficult pitches make a free-ascent out of the realms of consideration for most 
            climbers. So, of the hundreds of teams on the Nose every season (only around half 
            of whom make it to the top), nearly all of them are aid-climbing quite a few of the 
            pitches. And the people 
            who don’t get to the top? As a result of its popularity, there are well-equipped 
            escape routes from various points in the first half of the climb.`}/>

            <ArticleText text={`How hard is the aid climbing? Not very - and this creates a bit 
            of a problem. It’s one of the most coveted climbs in the valley, not 
            technically difficult, forgiving to the underprepared, and the queues of 
            teams strung along the route eliminate the need for anything that resembles route 
            finding. So why climb it? At the end of the day, it will always be the Nose, and 
            you'll always want to. And truthfully, the scale of the route did still 
            excite the adventurer within. 2 or 3 days can always be struggled through in 
            pretty sub-optimal conditions, but 5 days - not so much. Personally, I'd be more excited 
            by a 5 day self-supported hike than a walk in the countryside, for no other reason than 
            how long it would take.`}/>

            <ArticleText text={`It's not often the case that a big part of my motivation to 
            climb something is to get the tick. But if that is the case, then you better be damn 
            sure you're going to make it. Three or so weeks in the valley isn't as much as it sounds when a 
            single climb can take 3-5 days, so preparing a piss-poor 
            performance prior to our flight seemed like the right idea. The nearest 
            small-wall to London was a chossy sea cliff near Bournemouth which prepared 
            us only for the baking Californian sunshine and the fact that aid-climbing is 
            fundamentally un-enjoyable.`}/>

            <ArticleText indent={true} text={`We did set off up an unestablished micro crack 
            in a dusty groove which turned out to be harder and more scary than any of the 
            aid-climbing that I did in the Yosemite Valley. A couple of RP’s equalised with 
            a sling, and a #0.2 microcam exploding with a fractured lobe - all above a ground fall 
            potential. For the inquisitive: it definitely wasn’t an official first-ascent once I had 
            put a micro-trax on the abseil line as a backup (having remembered it was just a training 
            trip). `}/>

            <ArticleText indent={true} text={`We were four, stood at the toe of the Nose in the 
            purple-blue dawn of the first day. It didn’t look altogether that far to the top,

            and compressed. It was more bewildering than intimidating. `}/>

            <ArticleText text={`Strategy plays a big part in the early stages of the climb when 
            the ground is still within arm’s reach. Avoiding queues, maximising progress, and 
            saving food and water – all good things in the balance. It's popular to climb to Sickle 
            Ledge, around 150m up, without haul bags, then abseil back 
            to the ground using three ropes tied together. You can then spend one more night in 
            luxury, before ascending your fixed ropes and hauling your bags up to your high point. 
            Word was going round that the queues had been bad over the last few days. We had even 
            spoken to a team from North Wales who had had to bail on day two - likely to run out 
            of food and water in the hold up. In a bid to get out ahead of rush-hour, we were 
            going to haul our bags to our high point on day 1 and sleep on the ledge. One more night on 
            the wall in favour of starting pitch 5 at dawn on day 2. `}/>

            cracks were really worn out and it made for some of the most insecure climbing on 
            the route. Two teams of locals passed us, climbing very fast and light to 
            practice just this first section of the Nose in preparation for a NIAD (Nose In A 
                Day) later in the season. They all said it’s plain sailing once you get through

            us and the top were no coincidence. She is also a brilliant photographer and I’ve 
            used her photos alongside mine throughout this article. A camera in each climbing 
            pair was sensible – so once at Sickle, I would abseil to the ground to meet Alex 
            and the bags while Stu and Jo fixed the first pitch above Sickle. We would need 
            some separation between our 2 sub-teams for the rest of the route. Unfortunately, 
            that’s not quite how it panned out.`}/>

            to my left, 4.5 ft square. Stu and Jo on a 2-man portaledge hanging 
            just above Alex, leaving no room to sit up. The others had eaten while I was making 
            my second trip down the fixed lines, this time in the dark, to attach the other bag 
            to the rope for 
            hauling. The plan of hauling both bags in one go had failed miserably. We had used 
            a 3-to-1 space hauling setup for the first 60m which turned out to be too slow 
            and awkward. There was 105 kg of water in the bags before even considering the 
            weight of portaledges and food. `}/>

            a lot of doubt into people’s minds. Truthfully, I felt frustrated and a bit 
            betrayed in what felt like an atmosphere of resignation. I feel it’s

            been too overwhelming. I don’t believe anyone else set an alarm, certainly no

            us bailing, before deciding to carry on and re-asses the following morning.

            following week. Alex would have some company for the 16 abseils. Stu, Jo

            doesn’t get more publicity – it seems to me to be a hidden crux of the whole route. 
            It was the only part that felt truly irresponsible, and that thought came to me 
            halfway up it. Feet on one wall, back pressed up against the wall opposite – the 
            two walls making up the sides of a ridiculous 3ft wide alley between two 50ft 
            tall buildings. There’s one bolt halfway up on the far right, but the topo said 
            it was easier on the left, so left and bolt-less it was. I was watching the rope 
            dangling between my legs, not clipped to anything between me and a gentle curl 
            as it lay on the rocky bottom of this crazy aerial alley. To be honest, it’s 
            unpleasant to write about even now. Stood on top of the 
            huge flake was the only time I felt the sense 
            of extreme exposure that comes with a kilometre high rock face. The rest of the 
            time I was totally acclimatised. Waking up to the drop, hanging in hundreds of 
            meters of darkness, none of these times was I moved from the surreal to the 
            frightened – but climbing 50ft essentially unattached really reset my system. `}/>
