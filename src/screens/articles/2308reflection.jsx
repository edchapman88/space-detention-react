        sketched out in a group chat, but it is brought to life with the thick felt tip of personal 
        expectation. Motivation is a tangled mess of things that aren't faced until the 
        plan unravels. We wanted to climb winter routes in the Alps. Eight days with a flat 
        in Chamonix, five minutes walk from the Midi lift which takes you straight up to 3842m, 
        right in the heart of the Mont Blanc Massif.`}

        text={`Avalanches. They are deadly and they are frighteningly intangible. Your 
        interpretation of a forecast sometimes tells you more about yourself than it does the snow. 
        There is a temptation to leap on the slightest improvement: the north-westerly slopes are now 
        3-reated rather than 4; “avalanches are likely to release spontaneously” is an improvement on 
        “avalanches are likely to be triggered by climbers”. Reading the forecasts this way is a 
        highroad to killing yourself. But it takes a lot of strength to avoid 
        slipping into this relativistic approach, several groundhog-days into a week of terrible forecasts. You become  
        desensitised to the grim reality of an avalanche, reading the same reports for days on 
        end, as you grow restless and frustrated. In Chamonix I felt like the fun police. Had my appetite for risk 
      waned? If we had just spent 5 perfect days on the mountain, would we really head out tomorrow, 
      conditions as they are?`}

      overhung crag down the road from Chamonix. The always-dry ledges and squats at the base of the 
      routes felt a bit lived in, and a comfort we hadn't flown to France for. I found a certain 
      satisfaction to scoring the 
      drilled axe slots, like playing a video game or pocketing several balls in a row in snooker. 
      Learning the tricks for scratching up rock in winter gear would be useful in the future.`}

      hard routes. Harder than last year because that was last year, and it’s not really proper 
      climbing if it’s not a VI or VII, or an VIII? We climbed a couple of V’s, a II and a 
      III. On the third day we managed two trips to McDonald's and an afternoon at the bouldering 
      wall.`}

        text={`So where does the plan end and the expectation begin? Are you 
      motivated by the plan or by your expectation? I was reflecting in a 
      rain-lashed cafe in Chamonix, watching the cabin-less Midi cables lean in the wind. I was sure that I'm 
      motivated by adventure, but after a real spagetti-western of a plan I'd ended up in a cafe
      questioning what adventure really was.`}

        text={`In Scotland, I opened the door to the van at Aviemore train station and 
      immediately spotted a crate of Tenzing. Not a four pack, a full slab. My brother had been in 
      the Highlands for over a week on a multi-partner relay between Ben Nevis and the Cairngorm 
      Ski-center. The rucksacks we climb with in winter are heavy and there's rarely an option to 
        leave one at the bottom of the climb to collect later, so every kilo counts. There are a number of reasons 
      why you might decide against packing a Tenzing for the top. It's got caffeine in: if there's 
      a chance you might run out of water (almost inevitable), you don't want any of the liquid you're 
      carrying to be dehydrating. It's crushable: and then totally useless along with any 
      layers caught in the cross-fire. It's not refillable: so you run out of water twice.`}

        an axe in 
      the biting black wind. Carbonated drinks 5 or so degrees below 
      fridge temperature feel like expensive silk to a thirsty tongue. On long walk-offs I think 
      about how worlds collide on an adventure. There is the world of rucksack packing and map scouring 
      in which the Tenzing can is a bit of a complacent gesture. Disapproved by the plan maker and a 
      sore thumb in the rucksack - especially after it's used and useless.`}

        text={`A Tenzing can plays a different role in the world of fear, euphoria and the 
        dread of never-ending descent tracks. Sifting through these memories, there are hang-over like endurances: 
      with enough discomfort to wish it were over, but not quite enough to have wished it were avoided. 
      There's truely unclouded euphoria when we would stop, rifle though our packs and take the 
      first few sips of Tenzing at the top. At the very least, you begin the tiresome descent with 
      a burst of hope.`}

      the back of the corrie, but we couldn't see the features of the rock to begin 
      feeling optimistic or fearful. Large drifts of snow swept down the gully separating us from 
      the crag. Beneath the lee-side faces of these drifts a view of the buttress was obscured and 
      we kicked up and across towards the crest. As we moved, the famous blocky corner and offwidth

      a high toe spiked into a hole that is shaped like fingered playdough. Moving over it and 
      feeling the cool rock through the thin layer of black gortex between my knee and the wall, 
      reaching and hooking up into a tight vertical seam. `}

      promise of thick ice on Ben Nevis. I had a theory that the enthusiastic reports had more to

      the retreating snow pack. Roped together now, and leading up to the narrowing exit, I turned around. 
      Afraid that I might detatch the sculpture from the sweating walls of the gully, bringing 
      everything down. My brother set off up the alternative. The loose buttress to our right, 
      held together with moss and snow. We topped out onto a crisp mound overlooking the rest of 
      the Corrie. Low in the sky, the sun came through the clouds. It was disappointing how little 
      progress we'd made. I wonder: had the line been hard on paper we might not have been

      powder in the resort. We joked about how much money we were spending until it became 
      too sore to be funny. We took our ski-touring sets back to the shop to rent cheaper downhill 
      skis and a snowboard. The joke became which topics were not to be mentioned under any circumstances. Lizzie had bite marks on her 
      tongue after a high speed crash in the worst snow of the season, somehow only a couple of days after 
      the best snow of the season. The freezing temperature rose above the highest peaks and we were skiing in 
      the rain. We would have been spending a lot of money and having no fun if we took things too 
      seriously. Or if we expected what we'd expected. As it turned out we spent more time in hysterics
       than we did climbing snow or ice, and that isn't a metric that I'm going to start using for planning
