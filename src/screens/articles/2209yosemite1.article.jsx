             should aim to be on the first pitch of Washington Column by 2pm. I thought we

             550m tall tower of rock standing beneath North Dome. The route we were on is a classic

              the crack to the top. Hanging in the middle of the face 24 hours later, there’s
               not a triangular bit in sight and all you’ve got for direction 
               is a hand drawn topo that looks more like a pre-metrication game of snakes 
               and ladders. It’s useful to know 1 meter is about 3 feet - though when you’re 
               jet lagged and you’ve got sun cream in your mouth, dividing 135 by 3 feels like
                the end of the world.  `}/>

               day’s climbing is a valuable trick – but climbing into the night above and 
               away from sleeping bags rolled out on the ledge below takes some motivation.

            <ArticleText indent={true} text={`This style of climbing was pretty new to us. When you aim
             for bigger and steeper faces, it becomes unlikely that there is a continuous line from the
             bottom to the top without encountering a few really blank, really hard sections. If you’re 
             not a world-class climber these sections are impassable. Unless there’s another way? That 
             other way is ‘aid-climbing’, and it is itself a real incentive to get strong enough to avoid it.`} />

            <ArticleText text={`Aid-climbing was new to us. We’ve done lots of free-climbing, which involves fiddling bits of 
            equipment into cracks and other features of the rock every few meters as you climb. The rope
             is clipped into these bits of gear and it catches you if you fall. When aid-climbing, you 
             fix gear to the rock as usual, then attach a little rope ladder to that fixed piece. Now 
             you can climb a few steps up the rope ladder. Precariously balanced in the top steps and
              reaching as high as you can, you place another piece of gear into the rock above. Progress 
              is SLOW. You’re aid-climbing because the rock is too blank and steep to use your hands and
               feet – naturally it’s fiddly work trying to get any of your bits of gear to leverage the 
               tiny features in the rock enough to support your body weight. `}/>

            to meet the leader because, suprise suprise, you can’t climb this bit of rock either. You ascend the rope – 
            easy enough – until you reach one of the pesky bits of gear that the leader left clipped to
             the rope to protect their fall. The rope is super tight because you’re hanging on it, the 
             gear is welded into the rock because your partner bounce-tested it to oblivion for fear of
              life while leading the pitch; and the pitch itself is so overhanging that down feels like up, 
              you’ve done 30 crunches just to stay upright and you’re beginning to feel a bit sick. 
              You’re pissed off about holding everyone up - all because your ascender is rammed right 
              up into a quickdraw and nothing short of a miracle or a 5-to-1 pulley system is going to

             a lower-out is. They are the bread and butter of making sidewards, downwards, or outwards

             rope between my partner above, and I below, and the rock is overhung like 
             the walls of a cave; what lies ahead of me is a petrifying rope swing into the abyss. 
             Some tens of minutes later my swing would diminish to a hang: plum below my partner, 
             tied to the end of a rope, hundreds of meters up. The prospect of a swing 
             like this is nerve-wracking, and even the sight of a free hanging rope swaying in the 
             wind behind you is a bit stomach turning. But you don’t swing out
              like that, you feed yourself out slowly with a clever rope trick – hence 'lower-out'.
               Nevertheless, it’s not for the faint hearted.  After a day on an
